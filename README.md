# WEB_SCRAPING
### By using Library(BeautifulSoup and Requests) , Let's deal with the web_scrapping

#### - My goal is to create a program that scraps the job_data from two leading job sites(indeed & stack overflow) and organizes it into Excel
  
- (version1) is only deal with the 'indeed'
 
- (version2) is combined 'indeed' and 'stackoverflow' and show them

At the last , i made a file of the type of 'csv' from jobs_data (convert_jobs_to_csv)
Then, i dragged that file into my google sheets
