# WEB_SCRAPING
By using Library(BeautifulSoup and Requests) , Let's deal with the web_scrapping

* My goal is to create a program that scraps the job_data from two leading job sites(indeed & stack overflow)
  and organizes it into Excel
  
 version1 is only deal with the 'indeed'
 
 version2 is combined 'indeed' and 'stackoverflow' and show them
